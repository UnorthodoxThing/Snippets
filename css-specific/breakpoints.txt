Since you're not sure what height and width to choose from,
select from the most popular devices:

"Most Common Used in 2019"
-360x640
-1366x768
-1920x1080
-375x667
-360x720
-768x1024

NB: Do the same for next year, use "Most Common Used in ####"

where, #### is last year's present date.
e.g. Today is 2020, i.e. use 2019
e.g. Today is 2018, i.e. use 2017

Therefore, you'll always keep up with the trend, designing for
most of the audience.

Determining your Breakpoints

There's two popular approach:
1. Device-dependent breakpoints, and
2. Design-denpendent.

Let the deisgn decide the breakpoints, not the device.
Each design is different.

Anyone who tells you to always use a particular set of breakpoints
is doing your site a diservice.
